# protein-function-prediction
 The notebook is about protein function prediction using a neural network with an embedding layer and LSTM layers. The preprocessing steps convert protein sequences into numerical representations, which are then fed into the model for training and prediction.  The use of LSTM layers indicates that the model is designed to capture sequential patterns in the protein data, making it suitable for tasks involving sequential data like protein sequences.
